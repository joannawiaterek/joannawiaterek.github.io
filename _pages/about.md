Hi, this is Asia. I build the missing bridges in international AI access governance and impact investing. I currently co-direct the [Centre for AI Security and Access](https://centreforaisecurityandaccess.substack.com). I also think a lot about the role of the Vatican in AI governance and peace-making, ensuring flourishing and meaningful future for all. In a different life, I would probably be a theatre actress as that’s where I grew up. In my free time, I love hosting dinners, going on adventures and running.
