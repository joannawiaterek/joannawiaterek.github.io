Hi, this is Asia. I am a social anthropologist working at the intersection of global development and AI governance. I have lots of questions about innovation and inequality; the impact of AI on the world order and our sense of meaning; and the role of the Vatican in providing moral leadership for the AGI transition. I did my undergrad at Cambridge in Human, Social and Political Sciences and my Masters at LSE, where I wrote my dissertation on Global Majority inclusion in the UN AI governance. Currently, I spend most of my time figuring out ways to operationalise international AI benefit-sharing and bridging security with access. In a different life, I would probably be a theatre actress. In my free time, I love bringing people together and running.
